## Voice generation on Eleven labs

```
A 35 year old British man with a warm, approachable voice. He speaks slowly and deliberately, like he's chatting with a close friend over a cup of tea — candid, easygoing, and genuine. His tone is calm and relaxing but never distant or formal; there's a natural friendliness and warmth that makes you feel like he's talking just to you. The delivery is unhurried and meditative, with a soft, measured cadence and natural pauses. Think of a likeable, down-to-earth narrator who's genuinely interested in what he's telling you — not reading from a script, but sharing something fascinating he just discovered. Relaxed, conversational, intimate, and soothing.
