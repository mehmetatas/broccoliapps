      <h1>About Us</h1>

      <p>
        Expense Tracker is a simple tool designed to help you understand and manage your personal finances. We believe
        that tracking your spending shouldn't be complicated.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        We're on a mission to make personal finance accessible to everyone. By providing a straightforward way to track
        expenses, we help you build better financial habits without the complexity of traditional budgeting tools.
      </p>

      <h2>Why We Built This</h2>
      <p>
        Most expense tracking apps are either too complicated or too limited. We wanted something in between - powerful
        enough to give real insights, but simple enough to actually use every day.
      </p>

      <h2>Built by BroccoliApps</h2>
      <p>
        Expense Tracker is built by BroccoliApps, a small team focused on creating useful tools that solve real
        problems. We're committed to building products that respect your privacy and help you achieve your goals.
