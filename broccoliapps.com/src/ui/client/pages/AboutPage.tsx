          Most apps want more of your attention. More notifications. More badges. More reasons to check back. We think
          that's backwards.

        <p class="text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Broccoli Apps builds simple tools that do their job and get out of your way. No streaks to maintain. No guilt
          trips for skipping a day. No dark patterns designed to keep you scrolling.

        <p class="text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <strong class="text-neutral-800 dark:text-neutral-200">Do less, better.</strong> Our apps focus on one thing and do it well. No feature bloat, no upsells, no
          "premium tiers" that lock away basic functionality.
        </p>
        <p class="text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <strong class="text-neutral-800 dark:text-neutral-200">Respect your time.</strong> We won't send push notifications urging you to come back. We won't show
          red badges shaming you for overdue tasks. If you don't open our app for a month, that's fine. It'll be there
          when you need it.
        </p>
        <p class="text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          <strong class="text-neutral-800 dark:text-neutral-200">No tricks.</strong> No addictive mechanics. No gamification. No social comparison features. Just
          useful tools that help you get things done — or not. It's up to you.
