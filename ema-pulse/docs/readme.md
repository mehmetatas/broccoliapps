# EMA Pulse: AI-Powered Self-Insight

Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) 

## The Core Idea

An app that captures brief, in-the-moment snapshots of how people are doing throughout their days, then synthesizes those moments into meaningful weekly reflections they’d never be able to see on their own.

-----

## Why This Matters

Traditional self-reflection is retrospective and biased. When someone asks “how was your week?”, people reconstruct a narrative from memory—usually dominated by peaks, endings, and whatever mood they’re in right now. EMA flips this: we capture *actual* moments as they happen, then reveal patterns people genuinely can’t perceive themselves.

## How It Works

**The Daily Experience (2-4 prompts per day, ~30 seconds each)**

Notifications arrive at semi-random times within windows the user sets. Each prompt is brief:

- *How are you feeling right now?* (quick slider or emoji)
- *What are you doing?* (tap from personalized categories)
- *Who are you with?* (alone, friends, family, colleagues, strangers)
- One rotating deeper question: energy level, stress, sense of meaning, physical comfort, focus

Users can add a brief voice note or text if something feels significant. The key is low friction—answer in under 30 seconds and move on.

**The Weekly Synthesis**

Every Sunday evening, the AI reviews the week’s data points and generates a personalized reflection. Not a dashboard of charts, but a *narrative* that surfaces:

- **Patterns you missed**: “You reported feeling most energized on days when you walked somewhere before 10am—this happened 4 of 7 days this week”
- **Context-mood connections**: “Time with your partner correlated with your highest wellbeing scores, but work calls during evenings showed the steepest energy drops”
- **Contradictions worth noticing**: “You rated Tuesday as a ‘bad day’ in your evening check-in, but your three momentary reports that day averaged higher than your weekly baseline”
- **Gentle observations**: “You mentioned feeling ‘behind’ in 6 of your 21 check-ins this week—more than any week in the past month”

The tone is curious and non-prescriptive. The AI doesn’t tell people what to do; it holds up a mirror.

## What Makes This Different

**From mood trackers**: Most apps ask you to log once daily, which captures reconstructed memory, not lived experience. We sample *during* life.

**From journaling apps**: We don’t require motivation or time. The prompts come to you, and responding takes seconds.

**From quantified-self tools**: We don’t drown you in graphs. The AI does the pattern-recognition work and translates it into language that actually lands.

**From therapy apps**: We’re not treating anything. We’re just helping people notice their own experience more clearly.

## Key Design Principles

1. **Radical brevity**: If a check-in takes more than 30 seconds, we’ve failed
1. **Ecological validity**: Capture experience *in context*, not in reflection
1. **Synthesis over data**: Users never need to look at charts unless they want to
1. **Non-judgmental curiosity**: The AI notices patterns without moralizing
1. **Privacy-first**: All data encrypted, no selling to third parties, easy export and deletion

## Initial Target Users

People who are curious about themselves but don’t have time for elaborate self-tracking. Professionals navigating burnout. People in therapy who want data to bring to sessions. Anyone who’s ever wondered “why do I feel this way?” but can’t pinpoint the answer.

-----

## MVP Scope

- Customizable notification schedule (3 windows per day)
- Core prompt set: mood, activity, social context, energy
- Weekly AI-generated reflection (text-based)
- Basic history view
- Onboarding that sets expectations and builds the habit

-----

## Open Questions I’m Still Working Through

- How do we handle weeks where users miss most check-ins? Partial insights or skip the synthesis?
- Should the AI ever make suggestions, or stay purely observational?
- What’s the right balance between consistency (same questions build comparable data) and variety (keeps engagement)?
- How do we handle sensitive patterns the AI detects (signs of depression, relationship distress)?

I’d want to build this with a small team: one designer obsessed with micro-interactions, one engineer who cares about notification timing and reliability, and someone with clinical psychology background to keep the AI’s voice appropriate. Start with a 100-person beta focused on retention and whether people actually find the weekly reflections valuable.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
